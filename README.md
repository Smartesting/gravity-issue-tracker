## What is Gravity?
[Gravity](https://gravity-testing.com) is a web platform that helps **Agile & DevOps teams** to deliver high-quality software faster by enabling them to **select** and **design** end-to-end tests accordingly to *how* their users truly interact with their software (this is what we call it Usage-Driven Testing).

Gravity works with browser-based application and integrate with [Cypress](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress). The setup requires only an account and the install of [our data collector](https://github.com/Smartesting/gravity-data-collector).
